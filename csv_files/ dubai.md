Is Dubai better for me?

This is a question that I have been asking myself a lot lately. I have been living in Dubai for almost two years now and I absolutely love it here. I have never felt so safe and secure in any other city. I also love the weather, the people and the lifestyle. However, there are some things that I don't like about Dubai.

The cost of living in Dubai is quite high. I am originally from South Africa and I can tell you that the cost of living in Dubai is at least double, if not triple, what it is back home. This is something that I have had to get used to and it is something that I am still getting used to.

Another thing that I don't like about Dubai is the traffic. The traffic here is absolutely insane. I have never seen anything like it. It is so bad that I have actually considered moving to another city in the UAE just to avoid the traffic.

Overall, I would say that Dubai is a great city to live in. It has its pros and cons but, for me, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. I feel safe here, I love the weather and the lifestyle and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is thinking of moving to the UAE.
