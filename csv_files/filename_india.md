Since the past few years, India has been witnessing a rise in inflation. The main reason for this inflation has been the rise in prices of crude oil and other commodities. This has led to an increase in the prices of petrol and diesel, which in turn has increased the prices of automobiles.

The main reason for the rise in crude oil prices has been the increase in demand from China and other emerging economies. This has led to a rise in the prices of petrol and diesel, which in turn has increased the prices of automobiles.

In India, the prices of petrol and diesel have been increasing at a faster pace than the inflation rate. This has led to a rise in the prices of automobiles. The main reason for this is the fact that the prices of crude oil and other commodities have been rising at a faster pace than the inflation rate.

In order to curb the inflation, the Reserve Bank of India has been taking various measures such as increasing the interest rates and curbing the supply of money in the economy. However, these measures have not been very effective in curbing the inflation.

The main reason for this is the fact that the prices of crude oil and other commodities are determined by the international market and are not under the control of the Reserve Bank of India.

In order to curb the inflation, the government has been taking various measures such as increasing the excise duty on petrol and diesel. However, these measures have not been very effective in curbing the inflation.

The only way to curb the inflation is by reducing the demand for automobiles. This can be done by increasing the taxes on automobiles. This will lead to a decrease in the demand for automobiles and will eventually lead to a decrease in the prices of automobiles.
