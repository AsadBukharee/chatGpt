Pakistan is a country with a population of over 200 million people. The economy of Pakistan is the 24th largest in the world in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), and 42nd largest in terms of nominal GDP. Pakistan has a semi-industrialized economy, which is the 27th largest in the world in terms of factory output.

The automotive industry in Pakistan is the one of the fastest growing industries in the country, with an annual growth rate of 20%. The industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% over the next five years. In terms of vehicle ownership, Pakistan ranks as the 12th largest market in Asia.

The automotive industry in Pakistan is a major contributor to the country's economy, accounting for 2.5% of Pakistan's GDP. The industry employs over 1.5 million people, and contributes to 4% of the country's manufacturing output.

The Pakistani automotive market is dominated by three local manufacturers, Honda, Toyota, and Suzuki. Together, these three manufacturers account for over 90% of the market share.

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the prices of automobiles in Pakistan. This is mainly due to the increase in the prices of imported parts and components, as well as the devaluation of the Pakistani rupee.

The increase in the prices of automobiles has had a significant impact on the inflation rate in Pakistan. The inflation rate in Pakistan reached a five-year high of 7.6% in December 2017, due in large part to the increase in the prices of automobiles.

The government of Pakistan has taken a number of measures to address the issue of inflation, including increasing interest rates and imposing import tariffs on a number of items, including automobiles.

Despite the measures taken by the government, the prices of automobiles continue to remain high, and are a major contributor to the high inflation rate in Pakistan.
