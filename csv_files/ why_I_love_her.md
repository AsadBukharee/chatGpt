#Why I Love Her

There are many reasons why I love her, but the most important ones are that she makes me feel happy and she is always there for me.

We met three years ago and it was love at first sight. I knew that she was the one for me. She makes me laugh and she is always there for me when I need her. She is my best friend and I can't imagine my life without her.

I love her because she is beautiful inside and out. She is kind, caring and always puts others first. She is also the most amazing girlfriend I have ever had. She makes me feel special and loved.

I could go on forever about why I love her, but ultimately it comes down to the fact that she is the best thing that has ever happened to me and I can't imagine my life without her.
