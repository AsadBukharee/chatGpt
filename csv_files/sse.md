# Using FastAPI for Server Side Events

FastAPI is a modern, high performance, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is an open source project built on top of Starlette, and inspired by previous web frameworks such as Flask and Hapi. FastAPI is an asynchronous framework, meaning it is limited to non-blocking, single-threaded operations. This makes it ideal for use cases requiring scalability such as server-side applications, streaming applications and real-time services.

Server-side events (SSE) are one of the most powerful features of FastAPI, and are used to provide real-time data to web and mobile clients. SSEs are a way for a server to push updates to a client, without being requested to do so. They can be used by web applications to subscribe to updates from a server without polling. This can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as pushing new data to a client when it becomes available or updating the UI with new data as it is changed on the server side.

In this article we’ll look at how to use FastAPI to create server-side events for a web application. Specifically, we’ll cover how to:

1. Define an SSE route in FastAPI
2. Send messages to the client
3. Respond to client requests
4. Handle disconnects from the client

## Defining an SSE Route in FastAPI

To create an SSE route in FastAPI, we use the `@sse_route()` decorator. This decorator takes a path as its first parameter and an optional `methods` parameter to specify which HTTP methods are allowed for the route. For example, to create a route that responds to `GET` requests, we could use the following code:

```python
@sse_route("/my-sse-route", methods=["GET"])
async def sse_handler(request):
    ...
```

We can then define our SSE handler function, which will be called whenever the client sends a `GET` request to the specified route. The handler function takes a `Request` object as its only argument. This object provides access to the request details and any query parameters sent with the request.

## Sending Messages to the Client

In our SSE handler function, we can then use the `send()` method to send a response to the client. This method takes a message as its only argument and will send it to the client as an SSE event. We can also use the `send_json()` method to send JSON data, which will be automatically converted into a string. The following example shows how to send a simple string message to the client:

```python
@sse_route("/my-sse-route", methods=["GET"])
async def sse_handler(request):
    ...
    await sse.send("This is my message")
```

## Responding to Client Requests

Once the client has received the message, it can send a response back to the server. To do this, we must define a response handler function. This function takes a `Response` object as its only argument and can be used to respond to requests sent by the client. For example, if the client sends a `GET` request with a `message_id` query parameter, we can use the following code to respond to the request:

```python
@sse_route("/my-sse-route", methods=["GET"])
async def sse_handler(request):
    ...
    if "message_id" in request.query_params:
        await sse.send_json({"message_id": str(request.query_params["message_id"])})
```

## Handling Disconnects from the Client

The last thing we need to do is handle disconnects from the client. We can do this by defining an `on_disconnect()` handler function in our SSE route. This function takes a `Disconnect` object as its only argument, which provides information about why the client disconnected. This can be useful for logging or handling any errors that may have caused the disconnect. The following example shows how to log the disconnect reason:

```python
@sse_route("/my-sse-route", methods=["GET"])
async def sse_handler(request):
    ...
    async def on_disconnect(disconnect):
        logging.info("Client disconnected with reason: %s", disconnect.reason)
```

## Conclusion

In this article we’ve seen how to use FastAPI to create server-side events for a web application. We looked at how to use the `@sse_route()` decorator to define an SSE route, how to send messages to the client and how to respond to client requests. We also looked at how to handle disconnects from the client using the `on_disconnect()` handler function.

Using FastAPI for server-side events can help make web applications more scalable and responsive. It can also help reduce the amount of polling required to keep the UI up-to-date. If you’re looking for a modern framework for building APIs with Python, FastAPI is definitely worth considering.
